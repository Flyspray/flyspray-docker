# flyspray-docker
official curated Flyspray docker setups

You know docker and can configure apache2 or nginx webserver in a secure and production ready way and want contribute to an open source project? Help us doing the docker side of Flyspray. :-)

This project exists to provide **official** and ready to use **uptodate** docker images of the Flyspray bug tracker in sync with official Flyspray releases.
